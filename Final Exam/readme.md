# INFO 7374 Data Analysis Using Python - Final Project

## Data Analysis on Death Records of United States

I have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle to perform my Analysis on **Death Records**

There is a main Death record file which is like a fact table. It stores only keys, their corresponding records are stored in the separate csv file.


*Data Formats*

1.Death Records(CSV) - https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/mortality

### Data Collection and Processing

* There is a separate Data folder which stores the Raw data.

Location Raw Data: <a href="https://github.com/Anurag0212/singh_Anurag_Spring17/tree/master/Final%20Exam/Data">Data</a>

* There are total 15 csv files which need to be merged together to create a processed csv file which is being used for the analysis.

Location Processed Data: <a href="https://github.com/Anurag0212/singh_Anurag_Spring17/tree/master/Final%20Exam/Processed%20Data">Processed Data</a>



## Analysis Performed


## Analysis 1 : Racial Based survival rate in United States for Males and females

* Restricted the dataframe for Natural death cases
* Grouped the result on Race, Resident status and Gender to get the count
* Plotted a grouped bar chart to display the result
